Data Engineering Pipeline: Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers

🚀 Streamlining Data Transformation and Analytics with PySpark and Databricks

About the Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust Data Lakehouse Architecture using PySpark, Databricks, and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The architecture is designed to handle data ingestion, transformation, and aggregation efficiently through a layered approach:
  1.	Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion and storage.
  2.	Silver Layer: Data transformation and cleansing for consistency and usability.
  3.	Gold Layer: Aggregated, analytics-ready datasets for downstream applications.

By integrating Delta Lake with this layered approach, the project ensures reliable, scalable, and high-performance data processing.

Project Highlights
  
  •	Azure Integration: Hands-on implementation of Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) for scalable and secure data storage.
  •	PySpark Proficiency: Leveraging Spark SQL, Delta Lake, and PySpark functions for data transformation and analytics.
  •	Databricks Expertise: End-to-end pipeline orchestration using Databricks notebooks.
  •	Delta Lake: Adoption of ACID transactions and schema enforcement for data reliability.
  •	Reusable Code: Modularized and structured notebooks for ease of scalability.
